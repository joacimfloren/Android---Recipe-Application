# Android---Recipe-Application
My first Android application. Browse recipes or create your own, write comments and register position via GPS.

A great application for the ones without inspiration in the kitchen. This app has all the things the most common apps has.
The app has user handling, a feed of recipes and the possiblity to manage recipes and create comments.

To spice up the application a bit I implemented GPS usage. The user could use the GPS to locate themself when creating a recipe or registring as a user, why you might ask? 
I wanted to learn how to use a GPS in an application.

To sum things up, this application was mostly created for learning the most common parts of Android development. The app communicates with an API and it handles users and has the most common features. This was a great first app to make!
